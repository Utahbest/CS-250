How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The manner in which I decipher client needs and execute them into a program is by considering what the client anticipates. The kind of structures that are used in the framework determines how to meet the needs of the user. Meetings with the software development team and fostering an atmosphere of open communication support the implementation of the user's requirements. Because they help organize the various tasks that the user must carry out within the program, user stories can also facilitate this. Tasks can become more challenging for the team without the user stories, which can hinder efficiency and productivity.
  
#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 
  How I approach creating programs is by pondering potential requirements first. Then, by prioritizing, I try to balance the amount of time each task might take. This means that tasks will be ranked according to how long it takes to complete them. To comprehend this, you must first comprehend user stories, which categorize tasks as "large," "medium," or "small." They begin testing each task after identifying them until the desired outcome is achieved. Before moving on to the next task, I conclude by reflecting on the actions taken. SAFe, Kanban, DevOps, and Scrum at Sales are the agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work.
